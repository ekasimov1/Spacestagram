# Spacestagram
The App shows you an Astronomy Picture of the Day gitting by <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA's free API</a> based on the current date for default. 

You can choose any date and get a picture taken on that day. 

You also can like or unlike pictures. The App will remember your likes even after refreshing or closing the App. 

*This App was built as Front End Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2022.
